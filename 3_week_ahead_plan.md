***Weekend 1*** 
**Practical**
-Practice test writing (how to import from directory?, why is it not recognised as module)
-Continue course in 'Computing for Mathematics'

**Reading/writing** 
-Go through and until suggested chapter in Vinces course notes.
-Read suggested article and look for relevant literature sources (references).

***Week 2***
**Practical**
-If not finished continue with course in 'Computing for Mathematics'.
-Finish writing test for Vinces ABL code.
-Generate set of tests for the code that will be written on week 3.


**Reading** 
**For GA**
-Read through chapter 1 of 'Handbook of Genetic Algorithms' (to have a good general overview about GA) and briefly go through other chapters to see if relevant.
-Read through 'Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization and Machine Learning'Goldberg (Chapter 1 - 4, and review if other chapters are relevant or too complex for the expected outcome) 


**For GT and GA**
-Read first 4 chapters of 'Evolutionary Games and Equilibrium Selection' Larry Samuelson (thought to be relevant).
-Review suggested book from ABL video 'Game Theory Evolving' Herbert Gintis (possible relevant chapters 7 - 12)
-Read through 'An introduction to Game Theory' Martin J. Osborne (Chapter 1,2 and 13'Evolutionary Equilibrium')
-Read 'A guide to Game Theory'Fiona Carmichael (Chapter 6 'Evolving and mixing')

**Writing**
-Start writing (Is giving a background about Game Theory redundant?, Should it only be explained what GA is and relation to GT?)


***Week 3*** (by this point, I should have a general idea of what outcome I want from the program I will write) 
////What focus should it be used to build a relevant program?////

**Practical**
-Start writing code that produces some kind of result.


**Reading**
-Start looking/reading for the relevant sources mentioned in article suggested.

**Writing**
-Continue with literature review.
-Explain what TDD is and how tests that have been written work.
-Explain what is the intention of the code that is being developed and if there is enough progress, explain what has been done so far.

***Week 4***
**Practical**
-Work on the code in order to make it consistent and useful.


**Reading**
-Reading for the relevant sources (suggested by article, by other books found in library or any other relevant sources found in internet).

**Writing**
-Continue with literature review.
-Continue explaining what has been done so far with the written code.
